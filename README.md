Visual Imagery and Memorization Project:

Memory champions have been memorizing hundreds, even thousands of digits of pi, but how do they do it and how can we use this to help us in school?

Tutorial Section:

The code I generated follows the strategy that the Memory Champions use of splitting pi into triplets, and then creating mental images in their mind that make the numbers stick.

To memorize an arbitrary list of numbers like 273819748294 The code starts by splitting the numbers into triplets

273 819 748 294

Then I provide a key to translate the numbers: 1 = i, 2 = t, 3 = e, 4 = r, 5 = s, 6 = b, 7 = n, 8 = o, 9 = p

tne, oip, nro, tpr

The program then finds an adjective for the first letter, a noun for the second letter, and another noun for the third letter

Now we have 4 different acronyms that we can create a scene from in order to remember our arbitrary list of numbers

Talented ninja elephant
Ordinary ice pencil
New ring oatmeal
Talented party rats
Then I call DeepAI to generate ai images for each acronym to help you visualize the acronyms better and solidfy that mental image

Next I prompt you to re-input the acronyms and it checks if they are correct. After the acronyms are correct, you decode them to get the digits.

Application:

In the application tab, you can create your own key, which the code then compiles into a list, splits into triplets, generates acronyms and then generates images from.

then it prompts you to input your acronyms, and then decode your acronyms to your elements that you put in.
